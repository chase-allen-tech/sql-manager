>Search through your file system with SQL-esque queries.

### Setup / installation

  - Requires Go to be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing).

  - Install with Go:

    ```sh
    $ go get -v github.com/kshvmdn/fsql
    $ fsql # Should be located in $GOPATH/bin
    ```

  - Or install directly via source:

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/kshvmdn/fsql.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/kshvmdn/fsql
    $ cd $_ # $GOPATH/src/github.com/kshvmdn/fsql
    $ make install && make
    $ ./fsql
    ```

### Usage

  - Provide the query as a command line argument via stdin.

  - Query structure:

    ```sql
    SELECT <attribute, ...> FROM <directory, ...> WHERE <condition, ...>
    ```

  - Supported attributes:

    + `name`
    + `size`
    + `mode`
    + `time`

  - Supported comparators:

    + For numeric comparisons:

      * `>`
      * `>=`
      * `<`
      * `<=`
      * `=`
      * `<>`

    + For string comparisons:

      * `BEGINSWITH`
      * `ENDSWITH`
      * `IS`
      * `CONTAINS`

  - Also supports the use of `AND` and `OR` for ordering conditionals. Note that precedence is assigned from left-to-right (so `"WHERE a AND b OR c"` â‰  `"WHERE c OR b AND a"`). Use parentheses to normalize this behaviour (`"WHERE a AND b OR c"` = `"WHERE c OR (b AND a)"`).

  - Use single quotes (`'`) or escaped backticks (<code>`</code>) for multi-space conditionals.

  - Examples:
    
    - List all files & directories in `~/Desktop` and `~/Downloads` that begin with `csc`.

      ```sh
      $ fsql "SELECT name FROM ~/Desktop, ~/Downloads WHERE name BEGINSWITH csc"
      ```

    - List all JavaScript files in the current directory that were modified after April 1st 2017 (try running this on a `node_modules` directory, it's fast :sunglasses:).

      ```sh
      $ fsql "SELECT name, size, time FROM . WHERE name ENDSWITH .js AND time > 'Apr 01 2017 00 00'"
      ```

    - List all files named `main.go` in `$GOPATH` which are at least 1000 bytes in size.

      ```sh
      $ fsql "SELECT * FROM $GOPATH WHERE name IS main.go AND size >= 1000"
      ```

#### __TODO__
  
  - [ ] Add `NOT` operator for negating conditional.
  - [ ] Add support for querying and selecting using other size units (only supports bytes right now, add functionality for KB, MB, and GB as well).
  - [ ] Add unit tests (test files are empty right now).
  - [ ] Add support for regex in string comparisons (e.g. `... ENDSWITH jsx?`).
  - [x] Handle errors more gracefully (instead of just panicking everything).
  - [x] Add support for `OR` / `AND`  / `()` (for precedence) in condition statements (lexing is already done for these, just need to add the parsers).
  - [x] Add support for times/dates (to query file creation/modification time).
  - [x] Introduce new attributes to select from (creation/modification time, file mode, _basically whatever else [`os.FileInfo`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#FileInfo) supports_).
  - [x] **Bug**: Space-separated queries. Currently something like `"... WHERE time > May 1 ..."` is broken since we're splitting conditionals by space. Fix by allowing single quotes and backticks in query strings, so something like `"... WHERE time > 'May 1' ..."` works and evaluates the conditional to have value of `"May 1"`.

### Inspirations

Lexer & parser are loosely based on the amazing work of [JamesOwnHall/json2](https://github.com/JamesOwenHall/json2).
